## Objective
Implemented distributed messaging system in a client-server architecture, and utilize multi-threading and socket communication in Java.


## Steps:
1. Client establish a TCP connection with the server.
2. Client send a message to the server.
3. The server broadcasts that message to all clients currently connected and  clients display the message to users.

## Aims:
- Allows servers to join the network at any time. 
- Allows clients to join (register/login) and leave (logout) the network at any time.
- Guarantees that an activity message sent by a client reaches all clients that are connected to the network at the time that the message was sent.
- Guarantees that all activity messages sent by a client are delivered in the same order at each receiving client.
- Ensures that clients are evenly distributed over the servers as much as possible.
